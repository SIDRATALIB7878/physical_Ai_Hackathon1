# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Capstone Project

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This project aims to create a comprehensive, spec-driven book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It will cover topics from ROS 2 fundamentals to advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) integration with LLMs, all demonstrated through humanoid robot simulation and deployment. The book will be formatted for Docusaurus, include APA citations, and ensure all code and claims are accurate, reproducible, and clearly explained for a CS/software audience. The technical approach involves utilizing ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac (Isaac Sim/ROS), Whisper, and GPT-based conversational AI, with content structured into foundational and application-specific phases leading to an autonomous humanoid capstone project.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.x (for ROS 2 rclpy, scripting, LLM integration), C++ (for ROS 2 nodes as needed), Markdown for content, JavaScript/TypeScript (for Docusaurus extensions if necessary)  
**Primary Dependencies**: ROS 2 Iron, Gazebo/Unity (NEEDS CLARIFICATION), NVIDIA Isaac (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS), Whisper, GPT/LLM, Docusaurus  
**Storage**: N/A (book content is Markdown files, potentially local cache for assets)  
**Testing**: Unit/Integration tests for code examples (pytest), Docusaurus build/link checks, Code execution tests (Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, Isaac Sim/cloud), Hardware workflow tests (Jetson Orin Nano/NX), Pipeline reproducibility checks (ROS control, SLAM, navigation, VLA), Fact-checking with APA-cited sources, Capstone end-to-end task validation.  
**Target Platform**: Ubuntu 22.04 (development/execution), Jetson Orin Nano/NX (hardware examples), Cloud (AWS RoboMaker/Omniverse for simulation - if chosen), Web Browsers (Docusaurus output)  
**Project Type**: Documentation/Book (Docusaurus static site generator)  
**Performance Goals**: Real-time or near real-time robotics simulation and control, efficient LLM inference (where applicable), fast Docusaurus build times.  
**Constraints**: Word Count: 15k–20k per chapter (adjustable), Format: Markdown for Docusaurus, Citations: APA style (≥50% official/peer-reviewed sources), Timeline: 13-week hackathon quarter.  
**Scale/Scope**: Comprehensive guide to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, covering foundational concepts to autonomous humanoid capstone. Will involve detailed code examples, theoretical explanations, and practical applications in simulation and potentially hardware.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

*   **Accuracy**: Pass - All content will be verified against authoritative sources.
*   **Clarity**: Pass - Explanations will be precise and target CS/software readers.
*   **Reproducibility**: Pass - Code and workflows will be traceable and testable.
*   **Rigor**: Pass - Peer-reviewed or official sources will be preferred for claims.
*   **Consistency**: Pass - Uniform terminology, style, and formatting will be maintained.
*   **Standards**: Pass - Source verification, APA citation style (>=50% peer-reviewed/official sources), zero plagiarism, correct and illustrative code, Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 for writing.
*   **Constraints**: Pass - Word count (15k–20k per chapter, adjustable), Markdown for Docusaurus, in-text references + compiled at chapter end.

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a Docusaurus documentation structure, with content organized into chapters under the `docs/` directory. Each chapter will have its own subdirectory and `_category_.json` for sidebar management. Static assets will be managed in `static/` for global use and `docs/assets/` for chapter-specific media. Custom Docusaurus components or configurations will reside in `src/` and `docusaurus.config.js` respectively.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
