## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Simulate a Humanoid Robot (Priority: P1)

As a robotics student, I want to simulate a humanoid robot in a virtual environment to test its basic functionalities.

**Why this priority**: This is the first step to develop and test the robot's control systems before deploying them on a physical robot.

**Independent Test**: The simulation can be run and the robot's behavior can be observed in the virtual environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a URDF model of a humanoid robot, **When** the simulation is launched, **Then** the robot should be visible in the Gazebo/Unity environment.
2. **Given** the robot is in the simulation, **When** a command is sent to a joint, **Then** the corresponding joint should move.

### User Story 2 - Control the Robot with ROS 2 (Priority: P2)

As a robotics student, I want to control the simulated robot using ROS 2 to send commands and receive feedback.

**Why this priority**: ROS 2 is the main framework for controlling the robot.

**Independent Test**: ROS 2 nodes can be launched to control the robot and monitor its state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the robot simulation is running, **When** a ROS 2 node is launched to control a joint, **Then** the joint should move according to the command.
2. **Given** the robot is moving, **When** a ROS 2 node is launched to read the robot's state, **Then** the node should receive and print the robot's joint states.

### User Story 3 - Implement Perception and Navigation (Priority: P3)

As a robotics student, I want to implement perception and navigation for the robot to enable it to perceive its environment and move autonomously.

**Why this priority**: This is a crucial step towards creating an autonomous robot.

**Independent Test**: The robot can be placed in a simulated environment with obstacles and it should be able to navigate to a target location without colliding with the obstacles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the robot is in a simulated environment with obstacles, **When** a goal is sent to the navigation system, **Then** the robot should move to the goal without colliding with the obstacles.
2. **Given** the robot is navigating in the environment, **When** the robot's camera feed is monitored, **Then** the robot should be able to detect and identify objects in the environment.
