  "description": "The OpenAI Agents SDK is a lightweight yet powerful framework for building multi-agent workflows in Python. It provides a provider-agnostic approach to orchestrating LLM-based agents, supporting the OpenAI Responses and Chat Completions APIs, as well as 100+ other LLM providers through integrations like LiteLLM. The SDK is designed to handle complex agent interactions with minimal boilerplate code, enabling developers to focus on building intelligent, tool-enabled agents rather than managing low-level API calls and conversation history.",
