## Prompt

/sp.specify Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Capstone Project  
**Target audience:** AI students and robotics enthusiasts  
**Focus:** Physical AI, embodied intelligence, humanoid robot simulation and deployment  

**Scope:**  
Apply AI to control humanoid robots via ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and GPT-based conversational robotics  

**Success criteria:**  
- Design and deploy humanoid robots in simulation and/or real-world  
- Demonstrate ROS 2 control (nodes, topics, services)  
- Implement physics simulation (Gazebo/Unity)  
- Use Isaac Sim for perception, navigation, and manipulation  
- Integrate voice commands and LLM-based planning  
- Reproducible results on simulated and physical platforms  
- Technical claims supported by credible sources  

**Constraints:**  
- Word count: 10k–15k  
- Format: Markdown for Docusaurus  
- Citations: APA style, ≥50% official/peer-reviewed sources  
- Timeline: 13-week hackathon quarter  
- Not building: Full hardware lab, commercial comparisons, pricing details, non-technical ethics  

**Modules:**  
1. **Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** – nodes, topics, services, rclpy, URDF  
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** – physics, sensors, high-fidelity rendering  
3. **AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** – Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, path planning  
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** – Whisper, LLM planning, multimodal interaction  
5. **Capstone – Autonomous Humanoid**: command → plan → navigate → perceive → manipulate  

**Hardware/Software:**  
- Workstation: RTX 4070 Ti+, Ubuntu 22.04, 64GB RAM  
- Edge AI kit: Jetson Orin Nano/NX, RealSense D435i, USB mic  
- Optional robot: Unitree Go2/G1 or budget alternatives  
- Cloud simulation allowed (AWS RoboMaker/Omniverse)  

**Deliverables:**  
- ROS 2 packages  
- Gazebo/Unity simulations  
- Isaac ROS perception and navigation pipelines  
- Voice-command humanoid integration  
- Markdown documentation with APA citations  

## Response snapshot

Created the feature specification for the Humanoid Robotics Capstone project with minor readability improvements.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High  
- 🧪 Tests: None  
- 📁 Files: 2 created  
- 🔁 Next prompts: None  
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script was not working as expected. Manual creation was necessary. Investigate further.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script failed due to parameter parsing issues.  
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): FAIL  
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None  
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate `create-new-feature.ps1` to fix the parameter parsing issue.
