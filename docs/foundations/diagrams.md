# Conceptual Diagrams for Book Foundations

This file contains descriptions for the conceptual diagrams that should be created for the "Book Foundations" section.

## Diagram 1: The Perception-Action-Cycle of Physical AI

**Filename**: `perception-action-cycle.svg`
**Description**: A circular diagram illustrating the core feedback loop of a Physical AI system.
-   **Step 1: Perception**: An icon representing sensors (e.g., an eye, an ear, a radar dish) gathers data from the "Real World".
-   **Step 2: Decision-Making**: The data flows to a central "AI Brain" or "Decision Engine" icon. This component processes the information.
-   **Step 3: Action**: The AI brain sends a command to an "Actuator" icon (e.g., a robotic arm, a wheel).
-   **Step 4: Interaction**: The actuator performs an action that affects the "Real World," thus creating a new state to be perceived.

## Diagram 2: The Convergence of Technologies in Humanoid Robotics

**Filename**: `humanoid-tech-convergence.svg`
**Description**: A Venn diagram or a central hub-and-spoke diagram showing the key technologies that converge to create a modern humanoid robot.
-   **Central Hub**: "Humanoid Robotics"
-   **Spokes/Overlapping Circles**:
    -   Artificial Intelligence (ML, CV, NLP)
    -   Robotics (Control Systems, Kinematics)
    -   Sensor Technology (LiDAR, Cameras, IMUs)
    -   Simulation (Digital Twins, Virtual Environments)

*Note: These are placeholders. The actual diagrams should be created by a graphic designer or using a diagramming tool and placed in the `docs/assets/` directory.*
