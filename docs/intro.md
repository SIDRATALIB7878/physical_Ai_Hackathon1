# Introduction

Welcome to this in-depth guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book is crafted to lead you step by step from the core foundations of robotics and artificial intelligence to advanced, real-world humanoid systems powered by Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

The primary aim of this book is to offer a spec-driven, hands-on learning experience for students, researchers, and engineers. Rather than focusing only on theory, it emphasizes practical implementation and system-level understanding. Throughout the chapters, you will explore:

ROS 2 as the central communication and control framework for robotic systems.

Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim for realistic, high-fidelity simulation and testing.

Advanced AI techniques, including perception, navigation, and conversational intelligence using large language models (LLMs).

Real-world applications, culminating in a capstone project that demonstrates a complete autonomous humanoid robot workflow.

All source code is fully open-source, and every topic is supported by reproducible examples with clear and concise explanations. This book is intended to serve as a practical and reliable resource as you explore and build intelligent humanoid robotic systems.
