# Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid - Fetch a Beverage

This chapter presents the culminating capstone project: developing an autonomous humanoid robot capable of understanding a high-level natural language command and executing a complex sequence of actions to "fetch a beverage from a simulated fridge." This project integrates concepts and technologies from all previous chapters, including ROS 2, Isaac Sim, AI perception, navigation, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines.

## I. Project Goal: Fetch a Beverage

The primary objective of this capstone project is to demonstrate an end-to-end autonomous humanoid workflow where the robot receives a verbal command (e.g., "Robot, please get me a drink from the fridge") and successfully:

1.  **Perceives** its environment to locate the fridge and beverages.
2.  **Navigates** to the fridge, avoiding obstacles.
3.  **Manipulates** the fridge (e.g., opens the door, grasps a beverage).
4.  **Returns** with the beverage.

## II. Overall System Architecture

The autonomous humanoid system will comprise several interconnected modules, each leveraging the frameworks and techniques discussed earlier:

*   **1. Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Utilizes OpenAI Whisper to transcribe human voice commands into text.
*   **2. Language Understanding & Planning (LLM)**: An LLM processes the transcribed text, understands the intent, and generates a high-level action plan, breaking down complex commands into a sequence of executable robot tasks (e.g., "navigate to fridge," "open door," "grasp beverage").
*   **3. World Representation & Perception**:
    *   **VSLAM**: Isaac ROS VSLAM uses simulated sensor data (from Isaac Sim) to continuously localize the robot and build a map of the environment.
    *   **Object Detection**: Vision models identify key objects (fridge, various beverages) in the robot's visual field.
*   **4. Navigation**: ROS 2 Nav2, informed by VSLAM and world representation, plans collision-free paths for the humanoid. A custom motion translation layer will convert Nav2's 2D outputs into appropriate 3D humanoid gaits.
*   **5. Robot Control & Manipulation**: ROS 2 `ros2_control` manages the humanoid's joints and actuators. Manipulation actions (e.g., inverse kinematics for grasping, controlled force application for opening doors) will be executed.
*   **6. Executive Controller**: A central ROS 2 node orchestrates the sequence of actions, handles state transitions, and provides feedback to the LLM (for replanning) or the user.

## III. Simulated Environment (Isaac Sim)

The capstone project will be executed in a high-fidelity simulated environment created in NVIDIA Isaac Sim. This environment will include:

*   A humanoid robot model.
*   A kitchen-like setting with a refrigerator.
*   Various beverage models within the fridge.
*   Dynamic obstacles for navigation challenges.

## IV. Task Breakdown and Workflow

The "fetch a beverage" task will be decomposed into the following sub-tasks, with each step leveraging the specialized modules:

1.  **Listen & Understand**: Robot listens for a command ("get me a drink"). Whisper transcribes, LLM interprets intent.
2.  **Navigate to Fridge**: LLM initiates "navigate to fridge" command. Nav2 plans path, humanoid executes gait.
3.  **Perceive Fridge Interior**: Robot positions itself, opens fridge door (manipulation), and uses vision to identify available beverages.
4.  **Select & Grasp Beverage**: LLM/vision system selects a target beverage. Manipulation controller plans and executes grasp.
5.  **Retrieve & Close**: Robot pulls beverage out, closes fridge door.
6.  **Navigate & Deliver**: Robot navigates back to the user or designated delivery spot.

## V. What's Next?

The subsequent sections will provide practical guidance on implementing each sub-task, integrating the various ROS 2 and AI components, and finally, testing the full autonomous humanoid workflow.

## VI. Capstone Challenge Problems

These exercises encourage further exploration and customization of the "Fetch a Beverage" capstone project.

1.  **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance**:
    *   Introduce dynamic obstacles (e.g., a moving cart or another robot) into the simulated kitchen environment.
    *   Modify the navigation stack to enable the humanoid to robustly avoid these dynamic obstacles while navigating.
2.  **Specific Beverage Retrieval**:
    *   Extend the object detection capabilities to differentiate between various types of beverages (e.g., soda can, water bottle, juice carton).
    *   Modify the LLM planning to allow the user to request a *specific* beverage ("Robot, get me a Coke") and have the robot identify and grasp only that item.
3.  **Human-Robot Handover**:
    *   Implement a safe and reliable human-robot handover protocol. When the robot reaches the "delivery spot," it should detect the human's hand, position the beverage for handover, and release it gently.
    *   This could involve using force sensors on the robot's gripper or vision to detect the human's hand.
4.  **Error Recovery and Re-planning**:
    *   Introduce simulated failures (e.g., dropping the beverage, unable to open the fridge door).
    *   Implement error detection mechanisms and integrate a re-planning capability (potentially leveraging the LLM or a classical planner) to recover from these failures and complete the task.
5.  **Multi-Command Sequencing**:
    *   Allow the user to issue a sequence of commands (e.g., "First, get me a drink, then clean up the spill on the counter").
    *   The LLM planner should be able to process and execute these multi-step instructions sequentially.
6.  **Simulated Social Interaction**:
    *   Integrate simple conversational capabilities where the robot can provide status updates ("Navigating to fridge," "Grasping beverage") or ask clarifying questions ("Which drink would you like?").
    *   This would involve extending the TTS component and feedback loops to the LLM.
