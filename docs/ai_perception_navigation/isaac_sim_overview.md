# Isaac Sim Overview and Basic Setup

This chapter introduces NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a powerful robotics simulation platform built on Omniverse. We will cover its installation, basic configuration, environment creation, and robot integration, with a focus on preparing for perception and navigation tasks.

## I. Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a robotics simulation application that accelerates the development, testing, and management of AI-based robots. Built on NVIDIA Omniverse, it provides a high-fidelity, physically accurate virtual environment for simulating robots, sensors, and dynamic scenes. Key features include:

*   **PhysX for Robotics**: Advanced, GPU-accelerated physics engine for realistic robot and environment interactions.
*   **Omniverse Renderer**: Photorealistic, real-time ray-tracing capabilities for highly accurate sensor simulation (cameras, LiDAR, radar).
*   **ROS 2 Integration**: Native and optimized bridges for seamless communication with the Robot Operating System 2.
*   **Synthetic Data Generation**: Tools like Omniverse Replicator for generating large, diverse, and automatically labeled datasets for AI training.

## II. Isaac Sim Installation and Setup

Isaac Sim is typically installed via the NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher.

1.  **Install Omniverse Launcher**: Download and install the NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher from the NVIDIA Developer website.
2.  **Install Isaac Sim**: Within the Omniverse Launcher, navigate to the "Exchange" tab, search for "Isaac Sim," and install it.
3.  **Launch Isaac Sim**: Launch Isaac Sim from the Omniverse Launcher. This will open the Isaac Sim application and a default scene.

## III. Basic Environment Creation and Navigation

Isaac Sim environments are built using Universal Scene Description (USD) format.

1.  **Opening a New Scene**: From the top menu, go to `File > New`.
2.  **Adding Primitives**: You can add basic shapes (cubes, spheres, planes) from the `Create > Mesh` menu to build a simple environment.
3.  **Navigating the Viewport**: Use standard 3D controls:
    *   **Pan**: Middle-mouse button + drag
    *   **Orbit**: Alt + Left-mouse button + drag
    *   **Zoom**: Scroll wheel or Alt + Right-mouse button + drag
4.  **Saving the Scene**: Save your scene as a USD file (e.g., `my_simple_env.usd`).

## IV. Importing and Configuring a Robot

You can import URDF models directly into Isaac Sim.

1.  **Open Stage Panel**: If not visible, go to `Window > Stage`.
2.  **Import URDF**:
    *   Right-click in the `Stage` panel and select `Create > Physics > Robot > Import URDF`.
    *   Browse to your `simple_humanoid.urdf` file (e.g., `docs/systems/assets/simple_humanoid.urdf`).
    *   Configure import options (e.g., `fix_base`, `self_collision`). Click `Import`.
3.  **Adjusting Robot Pose**:
    *   Select the imported robot in the `Stage` panel.
    *   Use the `Transform` tools (Translate, Rotate) to position your robot in the scene.
4.  **Enabling Physics**:
    *   Ensure the USD stage has a `Physics Scene` (usually added by default).
    *   Click the `Play` button (triangle icon) in the bottom timeline to start the physics simulation. Your robot should fall if not constrained or if its base is not fixed.

## V. Basic Sensor Setup (Conceptual)

Isaac Sim allows you to add virtual sensors to your robot for perception tasks.

1.  **Add a Camera**:
    *   Select a link on your robot (e.g., `head_link`).
    *   Right-click on the selected link in the `Stage` panel and select `Add Component > Camera`.
    *   Adjust camera properties (resolution, FOV) in the `Property` panel.
2.  **Add a LiDAR**:
    *   Similarly, add a `Lidar` component to a robot link.
    *   Configure LiDAR parameters (range, points per scan, update rate).
3.  **ROS 2 Output**: Isaac Sim can directly publish sensor data to ROS 2 topics. This configuration is typically done through specific ROS 2 components attached to the sensors or the robot.

## VI. What's Next?

With the basic setup complete, the next chapters will dive into advanced sensor configuration, generating synthetic datasets, and integrating VSLAM and Nav2 for autonomous perception and navigation.

## VII. Exercises

1.  **Create a More Complex Environment**:
    *   Using Isaac Sim's primitive shapes and potentially imported assets (if available), create an indoor environment with multiple rooms, corridors, and various obstacles (e.g., tables, chairs).
    *   Save this environment as a new USD file.
2.  **Add Different Sensor Types**:
    *   To your `simple_humanoid.urdf` (after importing it into Isaac Sim), add a LiDAR sensor to the head or torso link. Configure its parameters (e.g., number of beams, horizontal and vertical FOV, range).
    *   Add a secondary camera to the humanoid, perhaps on the chest, and configure its properties.
3.  **Experiment with Physics Properties**:
    *   In your Isaac Sim scene, add a simple cube.
    *   Modify its physics properties (e.g., mass, friction, restitution) and observe how it interacts with the humanoid robot during simulation.
    *   Try applying forces or impulses to objects and the robot manually using the Isaac Sim UI tools.
4.  **Explore ROS 2 Bridge Configuration**:
    *   Research how to enable and configure the native ROS 2 bridge within Isaac Sim.
    *   Verify that your humanoid's `joint_states` and the newly added sensor data (e.g., camera images, LiDAR point clouds) are being published on ROS 2 topics. Use `ros2 topic list` and `ros2 topic echo` to confirm.
