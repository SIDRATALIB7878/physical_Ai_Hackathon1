# Contributing to the Book: Citation Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for managing and formatting citations within the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Capstone Project" book, adhering strictly to APA 7th edition style.

## Core Principles

- **APA 7th Edition**: All citations (in-text and reference list) must follow the American Psychological Association (APA) 7th edition guidelines.
- **Source Verification**: All claims must be supported by credible, verifiable sources.
- **Source Quality**: At least 50% of all cited sources must be peer-reviewed academic publications (journals, conference papers, theses) or official documentation from relevant organizations (e.g., ROS, NVIDIA, academic institutions).
- **No Plagiarism**: Plagiarism is strictly prohibited. All borrowed ideas, data, or direct quotations must be properly cited.

## In-Text Citations

- **Author-Date System**: Use the author-date citation system (e.g., (Smith, 2020)).
- **Direct Quotations**: Include page numbers for direct quotes (e.g., (Smith, 2020, p. 42)).
- **Multiple Authors**: Follow APA guidelines for multiple authors (e.g., (Smith & Jones, 2021) for two authors; (Smith et al., 2022) for three or more).
- **No Author/Date**: Use title or a descriptive phrase and "n.d." for no date.

## Reference List

- **Placement**: A "References" section must be included at the end of each chapter or major section where citations are used.
- **Alphabetical Order**: Entries must be listed alphabetically by the author's last name.
- **Formatting**:
    - **Journal Article**: Author, A. A. (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical, volume*(issue), pages. DOI
    - **Book**: Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work*. Publisher.
    - **Website**: Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). *Title of page*. Site name. URL
    - **Official Documentation**: Organization Name. (Year). *Title of document/section* (Version number). URL

## Tools and Resources

- **Reference Managers**: Consider using reference management software (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote) to organize sources and generate citations.
- **APA Style Guide**: Refer to the official APA Publication Manual, 7th Edition, or reputable online APA style guides (e.g., Purdue OWL) for detailed rules.

## Review Process

- Chapters will undergo a review process to ensure full compliance with these citation guidelines.
- Reviewers will specifically check for:
    - Correct APA 7th edition formatting.
    - Presence of both in-text citations and a corresponding reference list.
    - Quality of sources (>=50% peer-reviewed/official).

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure the academic rigor and credibility of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Capstone Project" book.
